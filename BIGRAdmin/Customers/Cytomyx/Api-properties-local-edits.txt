# sed script to edit the Api.properties file that is deployed with a build

# You can't tell by looking at it, but all of the "[ 	]"s that appear
# below contain a space character and a tab character.  When changing this
# file, please preserve this convention so that the rules will match regardless
# of whether the whitespace characters in the source file are spaces to tabs.
# The easiest way to do this is to copy the [ 	] from an existing line
# to the new line.
#
# Example line:
#s/^[ 	]*\(abc\.def\)[ 	]*=.*/\1=new value/
#
# When we go live with this server, uncomment the commented lines below before deploying the final build.
