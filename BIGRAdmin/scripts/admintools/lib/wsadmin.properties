#
# Define environment variables for BIGR wsadmin scripts.
#
# **** PLEASE NOTE: In general, rather than defining environment variables
# here, you should define the variables as shell environment variables in
# setupCmdLine.sh, preSetupCmdLine.sh, or postSetupCmdLine.sh as appropriate,
# then make sure that the values of the shell variables are made available
# to the JACL environment through the automatically-generated
# wsadmin_profile_generated.jacl file (setupCmdLine.sh generated this).
#
# If you need customizations for JACL scripts that are specific to a
# particular machine, don't edit this file.  This file is meant to be the
# same on all machines to make script maintenance easier.  Instead, place
# a file named wsadmin_profile.jacl in BIGR_LOCAL_LIB.  If it exists, that
# script will be run whenever the wsadmin tool is run, following the standard
# wsadmin_profile.jacl script that is in BIGR_SCRIPT_LIB.  See the
# com.ibm.ws.scripting.profiles property below for more details.

# Define the profile files that will get loaded before any scripts are run.
# We put two profiles in the list: a general-purpose one that is not specific
# to the local machine, and a machine-specific profile to allow local
# customizations.  The two profiles are executed in that order, so that the
# local profile can override things done by the general profile if necessary.
