## Pathology Report
###############################################################################
lims.pvreport.title.comment=All samples from your supplier are verified by a pathologist.  This process is called Pathology Verification.
lims.pvreport.caseid.comment=Case ID: A unique alphanumeric code assigned each time a donor comes into a medical institution for a new surgery. Case IDs start with CI for cases where informed consent was obtained and CU for unlinked cases. This hotlink takes you to the Donor Profile and the Donor Case Report.
lims.pvreport.asm.comment=Surgical specimens are dissected into Sample Modules (ASMs) that vary in size, depending on the volume of bankable tissue. Each module is further sub-divided into individual samples by following strict guidelines that preserve the spatial relationship of the samples within the module. Modules may contain either frozen OCT-embedded format (FR) or formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (PA).
lims.pvreport.sampleid.comment=Sample ID: A unique alphanumeric code assigned to each sample extracted or derived from a Case. The first two characters identify the sample type (e.g. &quot;FR&quot; for OCT-embedded frozen samples, &quot;PA&quot; for formalin-fixed paraffin samples, &quot;RN&quot; for RNA, etc.).
lims.pvreport.evaluationid.comment=A unique identifier used for internal purposes.
lims.pvreport.primarydiag.comment=The identification of a disease based on the histopathological evaluation of its signs and symptoms, as defined by the pathologist at the donor institution according to the primary section of the pathology report.
lims.pvreport.primaryto.comment=The tissue in which the disease arises according to the primary section of the Donor Institutions pathology report.
lims.pvreport.primarysf.comment=The tissue or body region in which the disease is found according to the primary section of the Donor Institutions pathology report.
lims.pvreport.samplepath.comment=The pathologic description of an individual sample based on the microscopic evaluation of the sample, as defined by a pathologist for the sample being verified. Expand your search, if desired, by choosing all categories and subcategories that apply.
lims.pvreport.sampleto.comment=The tissue in which the disease arises.
lims.pvreport.samplesf.comment=The tissue or body region in which the disease is found.
lims.pvreport.nrm.comment=Percent distribution of normal cells in the sample upon microscopic examination.
lims.pvreport.lsn.comment=Percent distribution of non-neoplastic lesional cells in the sample upon microscopic examination.
lims.pvreport.inflammation.comment=This is a component of lesion. This field includes information only about inflammatory cells.  Other lesional components could be &quot;% Fibrocystic Change to Breas&quot; or % Hyperplasia.
lims.pvreport.nontumor.comment=This section contains one or more non-tumor components based on the type of tissue involved as defined during Pathology Verification. For example: Lung would include &quot;% Alveoli&quot;, &quot;% Bronchioles&quot; and &quot;% Fibrovascular Septa&quot;. Other tissues would support other structures.
lims.pvreport.tmr.comment=Percent distribution of tumor cells in the sample upon microscopic examination.
lims.pvreport.tcs.comment=Percent distribution of tumor hypercellular stroma cells in the sample upon microscopic examination.
lims.pvreport.tas.comment=Percent distribution of tumor hypo-/acellular stroma cells in the sample upon microscopic examination.
lims.pvreport.nec.comment=Percent distribution of necrotic cells in the sample upon microscopic examination.
lims.pvreport.extended.comment=Composition and additional structure information for the sample as determined during Sample Pathology Verification.
lims.pvreport.microappearance.comment=Appearance values at the microscopic level.  These are assigned to samples during Pathology Verification, and are either Tumor, Lesional, or Normal. Expand your search, if desired, by using Gross Appearance values as well.
lims.pvreport.pathimage4x.comment=An image (at 4X magnification) which is representative of the sample as determined by Sample Pathology Verification.
lims.pvreport.pathimage20x.comment=An image (at 20X magnification) which is representative of the sample as determined by Sample Pathology Verification.
lims.pvreport.prep.comment=The preparation number for this derivative product from its parent case.
